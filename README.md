# Diffusion Model
This repository contains code and resources related to the paper titled "..." by ... .
It is a simple implementation of diffusion model in  Pytorch. Depending on the input parameters <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239">Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09672">Improved DDPM</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502">Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM)</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12598">classifier-free diffusion guidance</a> may be run.

## Repository Structure

- `code/`: Contains the implementation of the diffusion models discussed in the paper.
- `results/`: Results obtained from experiments conducted in the paper.

## How to Use

Run the main.py to train the UNet and visualize the results. The use of a GPU is strongly recommended.

## Next steps
The next steps are the implementations of:
- Inception score (IS)
- multiple GPU.
